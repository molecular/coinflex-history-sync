TODO

 * exit with correct exit code (success or error)
 * items lists are defined in endpoints, but should be taken from API (coinflex promised an endpoint to query used markets/assets) or at least be in config instead of endpoints.json.
 * think about clock skew / timezone issues with starting from last endTime
 * mint, redeem, trades: store latest_t keyed by asset/market id
